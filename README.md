### The Data

This dataset contains the spirits purchase information of Iowa Class “E” liquor licensees by product and date of purchase from January 1, 2014 to current (October 2016).

The state of Iowa provides many datasets on their website.

Class E liquor license, for grocery stores, liquor stores, convenience stores, etc., allows commercial establishments to sell liquor for off-premises consumption in original unopened containers.
